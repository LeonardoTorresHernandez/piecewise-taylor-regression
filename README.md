# piecewise-taylor-regression
This project provides a powerful Python implementation of Piecewise Taylor Regression. It accurately models highly complex, non-linear data by breaking it into smaller segments and fitting a simple, robust polynomial to each one.  It's a "divide and conquer" approach to regression, perfect for capturing intricate patterns that standard models miss.
